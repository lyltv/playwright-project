## 📊 Test Reporting (Allure Report)

The project utilizes Allure Playwright to generate interactive and graphical test insights.

1. Prerequisite Configuration
   Ensure that the Allure reporter is enabled in your playwright.config.ts:

```TypeScript
reporter: [
        ['line'],
        ['allure-playwright', { outputFolder: 'allure-results' }]
    ]
```

2. Generate and View Report Locally
   Run your automation test suite to gather test results, then execute the following command to spin up the local Allure server:

```Bash
# Serves the HTML report on a local port and opens it in your default browser
npx allure-commandline serve allure-results
```
